    <h2>Restaurant's history</h2>
    <p>The Chinese Muslim Crescent Restaurant in Tanjung Malim, Perak, officially opened around January 15, 2020. Based on customer reviews, the restaurant began attracting attention as early as its second day of operation. As of June 2025, it has been running for approximately five and a half years.<br>

Since its opening, the restaurant has operated consistently every day from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., with a short break during Friday afternoons for Jumaat prayers. It quickly gained popularity among locals for its authentic hand-pulled noodles (mee tarik), rich and spicy beef soup, and refreshing fresh juices-especially carrot juice mixed with fresh milk.<br>

Customers also enjoy the open kitchen concept, where they can watch the noodle-pulling process live. Despite being relatively new, the restaurant has firmly established itself as one of the favorite dining spots in Tanjung Malim, thanks to its quality, portion size, and unique offerings.</p>
